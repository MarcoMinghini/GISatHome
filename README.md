# #GISatHome

This repository is about an [initiative](https://twitter.com/MarcoMinghini/status/1241996482594693121) I made in March & April 2020 during the home isolation caused by the Covid-2019 pandemic. For 20 days I shared useful GIS resources in 20 tweets, one per day, from March 24 to April 12 (Easter :hatching_chick:).

Tweets were about significant research papers, tutorials, courses, books, videos, events, calls, websites and web applications in the domains of GIS, GIScience and Remote Sensing, with special focus on open source geospatial software and OpenStreetMap. The full collection of tweets is available below.
